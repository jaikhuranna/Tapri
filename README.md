Our teamâ€™s submission for the Game Development track at NMIT Hacks will be a game called Tapri. The game will focus on a young boy working at a chai shop on the highway. Our game will aim to highlight the problem of child labor through an intricate dialogue system with the choices of the player determining the fate of the child. The game's immersive storytelling aims to raise awareness about this pervasive issue, prompting players to reflect on the plight of millions of children worldwide. With its blend of engaging gameplay and thought-provoking themes, Tapri offers not just entertainment but also serves as a platform for meaningful discussion and advocacy for social change. We will be using Unity for all the game mechanics, including the dialogue system, Blender for making models, and Ableton for all SFX work
